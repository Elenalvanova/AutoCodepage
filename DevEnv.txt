When configuring the Delphi project file and writing the deploy scripts it was
intentional to set up a portable development environment so that it is possible
to check out the repository and start development rightnow.

The following schema shows the directory structure required for the development
of the AutoCodepage plugin including a short description of the purpose of every
directory.

Directories whose names start with an underscore either get populated during
compilation respectively when running the deploy script or have to be filled
manually (especially the subdirectories of _npp). Since empty directories are
not allowed on GitHub they are not provided in this repository and thus have to
be created manually.

The directory _pluginmanager is a special case. Its subdirectory Win64 has to
contain the master branch of a repository forked from the GitHub repository of
the 64 bits PluginManager admin system. The URL of this repository currently is

  https://github.com/dinkumoil/npp-plugins-x64

Since the 32 bits PluginManager admin system is based on a web service the re-
quired XML file for the AutoCodepage plugin is provided here in the repository
under _pluginmanager\Win32.
